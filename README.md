# phone-book
Basic phone book with C++.

# description
This code has been written since at least two years now in a context of school evaluation.
The task was to write a C++ program that permit to manage a phone book as we do with our cell phones.
Then, we should be able to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) contacts.

# before run program
Ensure to have g++ installed. Then, run the code « g++ Menu.cpp Repertoire.cpp » in a terminal opened in
the cloned directory.

This code can be helpful to appreciate basic C++ using in a common use case, with file management.
It is also implemented a basic error management when the prompt entered by the user is not in the expected list.
For more details, you can either refer to Project_Report.pdf file or contact us by email. You can also write for suggestions.
